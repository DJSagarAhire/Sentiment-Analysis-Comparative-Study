      "#Machine Learning Techniques for Sentiment Analysis\n",

      "\n",
      "The dataset used is a random selection of movie reviews from the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). The selection consists of:\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "    <li> 2000 training reviews (1000 positive, 1000 negative) </li>\n",
      "    <li> 1000 testing reviews (500 positive, 500 negative) </li>\n",
